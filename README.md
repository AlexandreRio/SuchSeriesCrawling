You have to create a file under `res/` containing your tracker information.

The default file name ( set in `src/data/Settings.java`) is `tk.db`.

Every line as to match the following pattern:

    TRACKER_NAME TRACKER_RSS_URL

You can ignore a line by adding a `#` at the beginning.

If you can read french I wrote an article on my [blog](http://alexrio.fr/internet/coding/2014/01/15/SuchSeriesCrawling.html).
